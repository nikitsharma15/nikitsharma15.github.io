    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  </header>

  <h1 class="section" id="h1">Security</h1>
  <hr>
  <p id="p">Your privacy is important to us. It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you through our app, Vegito kernel updater.</p>


  <h1 id="h1">Log Data</h1>
  <hr>
  <p id="p">I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device
    name, operating system version,
    the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>

  <h1 id="h1">Information Collection and Use</h1>
  <hr>
  <p id="p">We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access,
    disclosure, copying, use or modification. We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law. Additionally the app uses root access for flashing (which is done only with the user's
    consent), and root is also used for some file management operations on memory card as Android Framework does not provide a straightforward way to operate on them</p>

  <h1 id="h1">Children’s Privacy</h1>
  <hr>
  <p id="p">These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I
    immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.</p>

  <h1 id="h1">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h1>
  <hr>
  <p id="p">I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective
    immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
